Final Thoughts
This project was fun. Getting more used to this new art. I started it with the html layout,
then the css initial styling, then checked for proper widths, margins, paddings for a good webpage experience.
Lastly, it was the final css styling, this was the fun part since I added personal content to the project.

The Odin Project 66% completed.
